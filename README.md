# nginx Hello World sandbox

I want to securely serve things to the public internet. `nginx` is a very commonly used tool for this, but I don't have much experience using `nginx`, so I want to learn how to use `nginx` to do regular `nginx`y things. In this repo, I'm going to start with hello world and incrementally build on that, adding the code needed to answer one "How do I do x" question per branch.

## "How do I do X" roadmap
1. How do I serve a static "hello world"?
2. How do I serve a site that takes input and returns an output based on the input?
3. How do I serve https responses instead of http?
4. How do I configure the server to only respond to specific IP addresses?
5. ... more to be added
